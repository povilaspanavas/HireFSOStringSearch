===================
This was made as assignment from FOS

THE TASK:
Write a program in c# that can filter a list of strings.  It should pass only six letter strings that are composed of two concatenated smaller strings that are also in the list. 

For example, given the list 

al, albums, aver, bar, barely, be, befoul, bums, by, cat, con, convex, ely, foul, here, hereby, jig, jigsaw, or, saw, tail, tailor, vex, we, weaver

The program should return 

albums, barely, befoul, convex, hereby, jigsaw, tailor, weaver

Because these are a concatenation of two other strings:

al + bums => albums
bar + ely => barely
be + foul => befoul
con + vex => convex
here + by => hereby
jig + saw => jigsaw
tail + or => tailor
we + aver => weaver
