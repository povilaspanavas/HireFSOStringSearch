    /// and shouldn't be included according to the assesment requirements. So, here is the link
    /// with included NUnit where you could just launch solution, compile and run tests:
    /// git clone https://github.com/povilaspanavas/HireFSOStringSearch.git
    /// Secondly, there isn't data about incoming string lists. For example, if there
    /// is lots of small strings, but small count of strings with length of 6, we
    /// could do different search (cycle trough only strings of length 6 ant try to 
    /// disassemble them, then search for disassembled parts).
    /// If that would be too slow, we could have dictionaries, where key would be first
    /// letter, and value hashset containing all the words starting with that letter.
    /// Thirdly, no mentioning if data is case sensitive. Just in case, I've made a 
    /// parrameter for that.
    /// Fourthly, there is no information whether two equal strings should get to results. 
    /// I decided to include only one of them, because most of the time in real life cases
    /// we would need only distinct values.
